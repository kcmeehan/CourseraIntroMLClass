Kathryn—

Mother’s Day is almost here, and if you’re still trying to figure out what to get the moms in your life, a membership to the NAACP is an excellent way to honor the women who give so much of themselves throughout the year.

Making the moms in your life members of the country’s leading civil rights organization makes them part of a storied legacy of women who have fought for and continue to fight for a more just and more equal America. It puts them squarely on the right side of history at this critical time in the story of our nation.

So, if you’re still looking for a great, meaningful gift for the moms you know, give them the gift of membership to the NAACP this Mother’s Day.

Sincerely,

The NAACP Team
